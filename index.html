                "Apex Legends is a free-to-play first-person shooter developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. Set in the same sci-fi universe as Titanfall."
            <p>
            <p>
                Apex Legends basically offers casual and ranked modes, where you play in teams of two or three players. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal in Apex Legends is literally to reach the top by being the last person or the last team standing. With outstanding character designs and diverse personalities, Apex Legends offers 27 Legends.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is well balanced in character abilities and Gun varieties. Each Legend has unique tactical, passive, and ultimate abilities that add deep strategic elements to every match. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My favourite character in Apex Legends is Pathfinder, who has a Grappling Hook as his tactical ability and a Zipline Gun as his ultimate. He’s great at fast repositioning and team coordination, using his zipline to help the squad reach better positions and control key areas of the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                In rank mode, Apex Legends has eight tiers from the bottom to the top: Rookie, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Predator. These ranks motivates players' competitive spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                In summary, Apex Legends is a thrilling and high-quality shooter that rewards teamwork and quick reflexes. Whether you’re a casual or competitive player, Apex Legends guarantees you a polished battle royale experience.
